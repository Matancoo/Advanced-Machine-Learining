**Variational Models**
- These models typically use strong priors over the latent variable distribution with simple parametric form and low rank. 
- Limitations include blurry results and potentially restrictive parametric choice of p(z). 

**Diffusion Processes**
- These processes transform data into noise by adding a small amount of noise at each time step. 
- The aim of reverse diffusion process is to map the distribution of Gaussian noise p(z) back to p(x) in many tiny steps. 
- Each stage of the process involves a small amount of denoising.

**Life of a Sample**
- Each sample is processed through time steps, shrinking to origin by a factor and adding random Gaussian noise until it contains pure noise. 

**Types of Processes**
- Variance preserving (VP) process keeps the variance unchanged through time.
- Variance exploding (VE) process maintains the variance of the image constant while adding increasing amounts of noise. 

**Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)**
- These equations describe continuous stochastic processes, providing the basis for diffusion modeling. 

**Inverting Fokker-Planck Equation**
- Fokker-Planck equation describes how the probability distribution of a random process changes over time.
- The solution to this equation is used to compute the "score function" in VE processes. 

**Denoising**
- The task of denoising involves removing noise from samples. 
- The denoising function D and noise n are used to achieve this. 

**Estimating the Score**
- The score is estimated through the process of denoising, not requiring normalized PDFs.

**Diffusion Models in Practice - Training**
- Training involves a series of steps: sample creation, shrinkage, addition of Gaussian noise, and training the denoising model until convergence.

**Diffusion Models in Practice - Sampling**
- Sampling involves starting with random noise and performing a series of steps to estimate the score and reverse the process.

**Diffusion Models in Practice - Point Estimates**
- The ELBO on the neg log-probability p(x) is used to estimate probability using a denoising model.

**Diffusion Models: Top Image Generators & Likelihood Estimators**
- Diffusion models surpass VAE and AR models at point density estimation.

**Conditional Diffusion Models**
- These models are similar to having multiple diffusion models that share the same denoiser, but they are conditioned on noisy image, time (or noise sigma), and conditioning labels.

**Classifier-Free Guidance**
- This concept involves denoising according to conditional and unconditional models, a trick that is not well grounded in theory.

**Text-to-Image Models**
- These models involve architectures that sample low-resolution and high-resolution images based on text.

**Latent Diffusion Models**
- These models involve a tokenizer, a diffusion process of the low-res token grid, and a dekonizer to map the synthesized token grid to a high-res image.

**Several Prediction Targets**
- Different loss functions are used for the denoising models, equivalent up to weighting different time steps.
- In practice, the choice of loss function makes a difference.

**MagVIT/MUSE**
- This technique involves using binomial noise instead of Gaussian noise, with the denoiser guessing all missing tokens at each step.

**Answers**
1. The main limitations of variational models in the context of diffusion processes are that they often use strong priors over the latent variable distribution, which can lead to blurry results as high-frequency (fine) details are often not low-rank. Moreover, the parametric choice of p(z) might be too restrictive.

2. In the context of diffusion models, the life of a sample starts from sample x at time 0. At each time step t, it shrinks to origin by factor x = x - x * f(t) (f(t) > 0) and random Gaussian noise x = x + g(t) W (W = N(0, I)) is added. At time 1, the sample will lose original information and contain pure noise.

3. In variance preserving processes, the variance is unchanged through time, with more being allocated to noise. In contrast, in variance exploding processes, the variance of the image is constant, while increasing amounts of noise are added.

4. Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) describe continuous stochastic processes and are used in diffusion models to express changes to the sample at each time step. The solution of an SDE represents the distribution of the sample at each t.

5. The score function is used to map the distribution of Gaussian noise p(z) to p(x) during the reverse diffusion process. It does not require normalized PDFs because the normalization constant (Z) does not affect the score function.

6. Diffusion models are trained by shrinking and adding Gaussian noise to a sample according to a noising schedule. The denoising model is then trained using the noisy sample. The process is repeated until convergence. Sampling involves starting with random noise, denoising, estimating the score, reversing the process, and advancing time until t=0.

7. Diffusion models outperform VAE and AR models at point density estimation, making them top likelihood estimators.

8. Classifier-Free Guidance is a technique used in Conditional Diffusion Models where denoising is performed according to conditional and unconditional models. This approach is particularly useful for text-guided generation, where conditioning alone may be insufficient.

9. Text-to-image models work by first sampling a low-resolution image conditional on text. Then, a high-resolution image is sampled conditional on the low-res image and the text.

10. Latent Diffusion Models function by first training a tokenizer to map an image to a small token grid and back. The low-res token grid is then diffused, and a "dekonizer" is used to map the synthesized token grid to a high-res image.

11. The choice of loss function makes a difference in denoising models because different loss functions weight different time steps differently. In practice, this can impact the model's performance.

12. The MagVIT/MUSE technique differs from traditional diffusion models by using binomial noise (removing pixels) instead of Gaussian noise. The model guesses and keeps the most certain tokens while deleting others, until all tokens are complete.

1. In the context of diffusion models, the reverse diffusion process works by mapping the distribution of Gaussian noise p(z) back to the original data distribution p(x). This is done in many very small steps. At each stage, a tiny temporal step is inverted, which equates to denoising a small amount. 

2. A noising schedule in the training phase of diffusion models is used to systematically introduce noise to the input samples. This shrinks the sample and adds Gaussian noise. The resulting noisy samples are then used to train the denoising model.

3. In diffusion models, a denoising function is used to remove noise from the sample at each stage of the process. It is an integral part of the reverse diffusion process where the goal is to recover the original data distribution from the noise-induced distribution.

4. The Fokker-Planck equation in the context of diffusion models represents the changes to the probability distribution of the sample at each time step in the reverse diffusion process. It serves as a fundamental equation in describing how the sample distribution evolves over time.

5. The Expectation Lower Bound (ELBO) in diffusion models gives an approximation of the negative log-probability of a data point. It's a function of the time average of the denoising estimation error, allowing probability estimation using the denoising model.

6. Conditional Diffusion Models are a variant of regular diffusion models where the denoising process is conditioned on certain variables such as a noisy image, time (or noise sigma), and conditioning labels. This offers greater control and specificity over the denoising and generation process.

7. Text-to-Image Architectures in the field of diffusion models operate on the principle of conditioned image generation. These architectures typically generate a low-resolution image based on the text condition, and then generate a high-resolution image based on both the low-resolution image and the text condition.

8. In the context of Latent Diffusion Models, there are several loss functions used for the denoising models. They include predicting the next time-step sample directly (x prediction), predicting the noise direction (e prediction), and a combination of both (v prediction). The choice of loss function can influence the performance of the denoising model as it determines how different time steps are weighted.

9. In the MagVIT/MUSE technique, binomial noise is used instead of traditional Gaussian noise in diffusion models. Binomial noise refers to the process of removing pixels (or tokens), which leads to a different form of 'noising' the input. Instead of adding Gaussian noise to the samples, binomial noise effectively erases parts of the samples. The denoiser then guesses all missing tokens at each step, and the most certain tokens are kept while predicted ones are deleted. This process continues until all tokens are complete.
