Different learning setups often require different loss functions based on the characteristics of the task. Here are some common scenarios:

1. **Classification Problems:** For classification tasks, cross-entropy loss (or log loss) is often used. This is because it effectively captures the difference between the predicted probability distribution and the actual labels. For multi-class classification problems, softmax cross-entropy loss is a common choice.

2. **Regression Problems:** In regression tasks where the goal is to predict continuous values, Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are typically used. These losses effectively measure the average magnitude of errors, regardless of their direction.

3. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** In GANs, the goal is to generate data that mimics the true data distribution. The original GAN formulation uses the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence as its loss. However, due to problems with gradient vanishing, newer variants like Wasserstein GANs use the Wasserstein distance (a type of Integral Probability Metric).

4. **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** VAEs aim to learn a compact, continuous representation of data. The loss function used here is a combination of a reconstruction loss (usually MSE or cross-entropy) and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which forces the learned distribution to be close to a predefined distribution (usually a standard normal distribution).

5. **Sequence-to-Sequence Models (seq2seq):** In seq2seq tasks like machine translation or text summarization, the loss is often a cross-entropy loss computed at each time step between predicted and actual sequences.

6. **Reinforcement Learning:** In reinforcement learning setups, the goal is to maximize the expected cumulative reward. Thus, the loss function is usually defined as the negative expected reward, and algorithms aim to minimize this loss.

7. **Image Segmentation:** For pixel-level classification tasks like image segmentation, dice loss or Intersection over Union (IoU) loss are often used. These losses effectively measure the overlap between the predicted segmentation and the ground truth.

Remember that the choice of a loss function depends not only on the type of problem but also on the specific requirements of the task, such as whether interpretability is important or whether certain types of errors should be penalized more than others.
